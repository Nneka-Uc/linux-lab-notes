#Linux Kernel
The Kernel is the major component of an Operating system. It is like the engine of the OS.
Kernel is the core interface between a computer hardware and its processes. Linux has a monolithic kernel but modular in implementation. 

-Linux is monolithic means that it runs everything by itself. It is in charge of Cpu Scheduling, Memory management and several other operations by itself.

-When I said that Linux has modular capabilities, I mean that its part can be dynamically loaded and managed. For instance, you add or remove parts without rebuilding the whole machine. You plug a new USB driver in a file system and its automatically loaded and when its removed, its unloaded without reloading the system.
